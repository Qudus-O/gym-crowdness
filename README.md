# Gym-Crowdness
Used SDGRegressor to predict crowdness at the Gym. 
I enjoy going to the gym, but I dislike it when it is crowded because I am unable to follow my plan at my own pace. I frequently have to wait for the machine I need to free up, making it nearly hard to follow my program.

As a result, I decided to create a prediction model using Machine Learning, namely a linear regressor using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

Using a dataset of over 60,000 observations and 11 features/ such as day, hour, temperature, and other characteristics, I built a model that predicts how many people will be at the gym on a specific day and time. That way, I'll be able to enjoy my exercise program without having to wait.
